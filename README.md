# SparkServer

This is the ASP.NET MVC backend and frontend for the blogging engine that powers SitecoreSpark.com.

# Notes

* Login functionality is provided by the SSO server at https://sso.brandonbruno.com - this requires a re-implementation of the Account controller to support other login systems.

* Certain pieces of the backend admin are written with specific workflows in mind and are not meant to always be user-friendly.

* This application is provided as-is: I will generally NOT be available to provide troubleshooting or support should you choose to compile and run it.

* Don't be surprised if you find plenty of half-finished code or interfaces without implementations - new features are always being worked on and aren't fully baked yet (and being a personal project, I don't always follow good branching strategies).
